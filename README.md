# Stripware
A simple RGB LED strip controller software with a gui built in Qt.

This project was inspired by vannevar-morgan's similiar project, [check it out here!](https://github.com/vannevar-morgan/Qt-RGB-LED)

## How to use
* Currently it's only working on Linux. I might port it to Windows later if I have the time for it.
* Pre-built binaries aren't available right now, but you can built it for yourself.
* If you're not familiar with the command line don't be scared, Its really easy just follow my instructions below.

### Dependencies
* For building you'll need qmake, qt5 and a C++ compiler
* You'll have to get these packages by yourself if you don't have them yet, I can't list all the distros here, but usually they are called the same as above.
* If you want to use git to clone this repository before building you'll need... git!
